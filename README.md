# terraform-xp

###Â Why do I need this?

Terraform is very flexible and you can tailor your workflow in many ways. As you do this, your terraform commands
can become verbose, hard to type and easy to get wrong.

This tool a wrapper around an simple but commonly used workflow, automatically passing terraform a tfvars file and configuring
your remote state without the need for verbose commands.

Run `terraform-xp --help` to get started.

### Features:

* .tfvars file inclusion based on `--env` setting
* Automatically stores a plan file from `terraform-xp plan`
* Forces `terraform-xp apply` to run only from the generated plan file
* Automatic remote state configuration based on settings in a `remotestate.ini`

### Installation

    curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrjgreen/terraform-xp/master/terraform-xp" > /usr/local/bin/terraform-xp
    chmod +x /usr/local/bin/terraform-xp
    
### Usage

The `--env` flag will set the name of the environment you wish to deploy. If not supplied, the default `global` will be used.

terraform-xp will automatically include a file matching your env setting, in the location: `envs/<ENV>.tfvars`.

Generate a plan file from the directory containing your terraform files. It will place the plan file in `envs/myenv.tfplan`.

    terraform-xp --env myenv plan
    

Apply a plan file. It will look for the plan file in `envs/myenv.tfplan` and fail if the plan file is not present.

    terraform-xp --env myenv apply
    
### Remote State

terraform-xp will look for a file called `remotestate.ini` in your directory and if present, the remote state will be set up before executing the terraform command.

The format should be:

    REMOTE_STATE_BUCKET=my-state-bucket
    REMOTE_STATE_REGION=eu-west-1         # Must match the configured region of your state bucket.
    REMOTE_STATE_PATH=my-new-application  # Key prefix for this app (E.G your app name), do NOT be change once `apply` has ran


This will place your state file in the following location, where \<ENV\> is the value specified in the `--env` flag:

    s3://my-terraform-state-bucket/my-new-application/<ENV>.tfstate
